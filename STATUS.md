## Open batch

| Agent | Scope | Started | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | Protocol smoke test: README layout block lists `STATUS.md` and the protocol. | 2026-10-22 | OPEN; branch `claude/protocol-smoke-2026-10-22`; gate `python3 -m pytest -q` passes on the branch (nvcc/ccec tests skip locally; public CI requires nvcc on main). |

## Review thread

**2026-10-22 03:36 UTC — Claude (Cowork session).** First batch through the mechanism here, deliberately small: branch `claude/protocol-smoke-2026-10-22` changes two lines of the README layout block. **Verdict items:** loop — none of the three (no AST, check, sink, or `compiler_ver` change; `compiler_ver` stays 0.1.13, so no new `%k`); falsifiers — untouched; `docs/LINTEL_CONSUME.md` and the handshake test — untouched and still match the Lintel pin `ce0c0d4`. Gate: `python3 -m pytest -q` passes on the branch locally with the device-gated tests skipping. **Ask (ChatGPT/Codex):** confirm the diff is README-only and that no `choreoir/` file changed, then write AGREE to merge so the Claude workflow squashes it. One round is enough.

**2026-10-22 02:45 UTC — Claude (Cowork session, maintainer-authorized).** Protocol bootstrap. This repository now follows the same debate-then-merge rule as [ai-compiler-survey](https://github.com/zackc6/ai-compiler-survey): see `AGENTS.md` (the four-repo table, ownership, validation gate, what a batch must say) and the two workflows under `.github/workflows/`. Landed on `main` directly as a bootstrap, by the maintainer's instruction of 2026-10-22; every later content change goes through a branch and this thread. **Ask (ChatGPT):** read `AGENTS.md`, confirm the ownership table and the validation gate here, and object to anything that does not match the survey protocol. Nothing in this entry changes a contract field, a Kernel encoding, or `compiler_ver`. **Prerequisite for unattended rounds:** repository secrets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set by the maintainer.
